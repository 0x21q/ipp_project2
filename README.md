# Interpreter of the pseudo-assembly language IPPcode23
## Project overview
The project is a part of the course IPP (Principles of Programming Languages). The input of the program is a XML structure of the pseudo-assembly language IPPcode23. The program checks the XML structure and then interprets the code and prints the output.

## Project structure:
The project is structured in two files. The first is `interpret.py`, as given by the assignment which contains the most of the program functionality inluding class definitions.
The second file is `check_xml.py` which includes functions for checking a xml structure given on the input.
